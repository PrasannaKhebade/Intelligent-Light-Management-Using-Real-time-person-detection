# Intelligent Light Management Using Real-Time Person Detection

## Introduction
The **Intelligent Light Management Using Real-Time Person Detection** project is designed to create a smart lighting control system that enhances energy efficiency and user convenience. This innovative solution utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to detect human presence in real-time, leveraging the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. 

By automatically managing lighting based on the presence or absence of individuals, the system reduces unnecessary energy consumption while ensuring optimal lighting conditions when needed. This technology can be applied in various environments, including residential spaces, offices, and public areas, offering both comfort and sustainability.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: 
  - Employs the YOLO model for fast and accurate detection of individuals in the camera's field of view. This allows the system to react promptly to the presence of users.

- **Automated Lighting Control**: 
  - Automatically activates or deactivates lights based on detected presence. If a person is detected, the lights are turned on; if no one is detected for a specified duration, the lights are turned off.

- **Arduino Integration**: 
  - Interfaces seamlessly with Arduino hardware, enabling direct control of relay modules that manage the physical lighting system. This provides a practical implementation of the automated lighting control.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: 
  - Features a simple and intuitive interface that displays the current lighting status and feedback on detection events. Users can easily understand the system's operation through visual cues.

- **Face Detection**: 
  - Incorporates face detection capabilities to further enhance user interaction. By recognizing faces, the system can provide more personalized lighting adjustments, potentially distinguishing between different users.

- **Energy Efficiency**: 
  - Promotes sustainability by reducing energy waste, ensuring that lights are only on when necessary. This feature is particularly beneficial in large spaces where occupancy can fluctuate.

- **Scalability**: 
  - Designed to be scalable, allowing for easy integration into larger systems or adaptation for different environments and lighting requirements.

This project not only exemplifies the application of AI and IoT technologies in everyday life but also serves as a stepping stone for future innovations in smart home automation and energy management solutions.
